# AMeI-paper

Example calculations for the paper - First Derivatives of Fuzzy Surfaces (J. Caha, J. Dvorsk√Ω) - **link to be provided**

Calculations are performed using [R project](http://cran.r-project.org/)

## Description

The files containing the experiments are stored in folder [scripts](scripts/) while [data](data/) are stored in its own folder.

The file [prerequisites.R](scripts/prerequisites.R) handles instalation and loading of all necessary packages for all the scripts.

Files [numerical_example_fuzzy_calculation.R](scripts/numerical_example_fuzzy_calculation.R) and [numerical_example_monte_carlo.R](scripts/numerical_example_fuzzy_calculation.R) performs calculations for the chapter **Numerical Example** of the paper.


The folder [data](data/) and file [rasters.R](scripts/rasters.R) contains fuzzy surface derivatives data from the **Case study: Analysis of artificial fuzzy surface** chapter. The file [case_study_points.R](case_study_points.R) performs generation of points used to create the fuzzy surface.
